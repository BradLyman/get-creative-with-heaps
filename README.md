# [Get Creative With Heaps](https://bradlyman.github.io/get-creative-with-heaps/)

This project is my exploration of the Heaps.io game engine with the goal of using
it for creative coding. I love generative art and the persuit has long led me 
towards interesting concepts in computer science, mathematics, and (of course) art!

# Getting Started

Install Haxe and HashLink for compiling and running the demos.
