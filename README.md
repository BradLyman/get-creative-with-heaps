(ISBN-13:  978-1616890773)

Heaps.io is a proven game engine implemented in the haxe programming language
and provides convenient cross-platform tools for application development.

## Install Haxe

## Samples

Each demo includes a README with instructions and a screenshot for the

Given that the subject is *generative* design, most of the emphasis will be on
dynamically generating graphics rather than loading premade assets.
