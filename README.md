# Get Creative With Heaps

This project is my exploration of the Heaps game engine through the lense
of creative coding and generative design. I love generative art and the
persuit has long lead me towards interesting concepts in computer science,
mathematics, and (of course) art!

## Getting Started

Install Haxe and HashLink for compiling and running the demos.

* https://haxe.org
* https://hashlink.haxe.org

# Demos

The repository is organized into standalone applications which I call "Demos".
Each demo depends only on the Heaps game engine and it's own source. Demos are
not organized by complexity *specifically* but as the concepts build from basic
to complex, the Demos correspondingly become more complicated.

* [P2 Shape: Basics of Shape in Design](https://github.com/BradLyman/learn_you_a_heaps/tree/master/P2-Shape)

# Additional Notes

The demos closely follow along with the Generative Design book (ISBN-13: 978-1616890773) 
which covers similar ground but for the Proccessing framework in Java. The demos
here necessarily require changes because the language and framework differ. Moreover,
I'm just chasing ideas when they strike me as interesting. So, if you like this repo,
go pick up copy of that book. It's excellent inspiration and a fun/different angle on 
the same subject.
