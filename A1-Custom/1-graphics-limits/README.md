# Overview

I keep running into strange behaviour while working with the graphics object.
This seems to be a function of it's expected behaviour as a general purpose
2-d graphics generator.

This demo is the first of an exploration of the Heaps.io engine on HashLink and
in the browser. The eventual goal is to create a 'Lines' graphical object type
which is optimized for rendering large volumes of lines on screen.
