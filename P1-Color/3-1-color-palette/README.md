# Color Palette

A color palette is a collection of colors used to build an image. One way to
generate color palettes is via a gradient - interpolate between two colors.

## How To Run

The program automatically starts when built.

```
> haxe ./build.hxml
```

## What Is Happening?

Each time the mouse is clicked new colors are chosen for the left and right sides of the screen.
The number of divisions between the left and right sides is controlled by the X coordinate of the mouse.
