# Color Palette

A color palette is a collection of colors used to build an image. One way to
generate color palettes is via a gradient - interpolate between two colors.

## How To Run

The program automatically starts when built.

```
> haxe ./build.hxml
```

## What Is Happening?

Each row of rectangles shows a hue interpolation from one color to another.
Click the mouse to select new colors for interpolation.
