# Usage

* The mouse's Y coordinate controls the radius of the circle
* The mouse's X coordinate controls the number of line segments used to approximate the circle

# Overview

Shape is fundamental to any design. This demo is a deconstruction of a circle,
showing an approximation who's resolution varies as the mouse moves. Future demos
will build on this idea with persistence for varying effects.
