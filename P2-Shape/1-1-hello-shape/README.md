# Hello Shape

![Demo Screenshot](https://github.com/BradLyman/get-creative-with-heaps/blob/master/P2-Shape/1-1-hello-shape/Screenshot.png)

# Run The Demo

```
> haxe ./build.hxml
```

**Usage**

* The mouse's Y coordinate controls the radius of the circle 
* The mouse's X coordinate controls the number of line segments used to approximate the circle

# Overview

Shape is fundamental to any design. This demo is a deconstruction of a circle,
showing an approximation who's resolution varies as the mouse moves. Future demos
will build on this idea with persistence for varying effects.
