# Hello Shape

This demo introduces the concept of *shape* to our design toolbox. Exciting
designs use more than just rectangles, and this is our first venture into
arbitrary shape in design.

## How To Run

The program automatically starts when built.

```
> haxe ./build.hxml
```

## What Is Happening?

The demo draws a circle in the center of the screen. The radius of the circle
is controlled by the X coordinate of the mouse. The resolution of the circle
is controlled by the Y coordinate of the mouse.
