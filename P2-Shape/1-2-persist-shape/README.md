# Hello Shape - Persist

Just like hello shape this is an exploration of creating polygons using lines.
But this time with a twist. The graphics are not reset every frame! Instead,
the graphics object is reset only when the mouse is clicked.

## How To Run

The program automatically starts when built.

```
> haxe ./build.hxml
```
