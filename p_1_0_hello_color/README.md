# Hello Color

The classic introduction to a new programming language is the 'hello world'
program. Instead, for this project `Hello Color` is the introduction to visual
design with Heaps.io.

## How To Run

The program automatically starts when built.

```
> haxe ./build.hxml
```

## What Is Happening?

Hello Color is an application which draws a foreground rectangle over a colored
background. The foreground rectangle's size is controlled by the mouse's X
coordinate. The HUE of the foreground and background is controlled by the
mouse's Y coordinate, set such that they're always on the opposite sides of the
color wheel.
